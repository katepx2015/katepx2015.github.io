index.html 

This file has been correctly implemented. It features a picture of
me and links to my resume and my bio, and redirects from 
katepx2015.github.io.

resume.html

This file has been correctly implemented. It contains my resume, 
organized via a css style sheet and passes the tests for a proper
HTML5 file. It contains no inline HTML styling. 

bio.html

This file has been correctly implemented. It contains a short bio,
which is linked to my index page.

resume_style.css

This file has been correctly implemented. It contains 6 rules for
styling within resume.html.

I discussed the assignment with my friend who is also in Comp20;
she helped me with linking the file in the index.html within the
school's server.

I spent about 4 hours in total, but spread out over a long period
of time.
